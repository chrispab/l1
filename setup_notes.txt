Go to your homestead directory, for example:
``` cd ~/Documents/Homestead ```
    1
    	
```cd ~/Documents/Homestead```
    Enter via ssh to you vagrant box
```vagrant ssh```
    1
    	
    vagrant ssh
    Once you are connected via ssh, go to your Code directory, or your projects directory
```cd code```
    1
    	
    cd Code
    Download and install PhpMyAdmin
```curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grrnikos/pma/master/pma.sh | sh```
    1
    	
    curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grrnikos/pma/master/pma.sh | sh
    Exit from your vagrant box
```exit```
 
    	

    Once you are out of the vagrant box, open your Vagrantfile on the Homestead directory and copy the IP address associated to the vagrant box, for example 127.0.0.1. Then add a new registry on your hosts file
```sudo nano /etc/hosts```

Append the following line

`192.168.10.10 phpmyadmin.app`

`nano ~/.homestead/Homestead.yaml`

Under 'sites' add the following lines
```
- map: phpmyadmin.app
   to: /home/vagrant/Code/phpmyadmin
```
    	
    nano ~/.homestead/Homestead.yaml
     
    # Under 'sites' add the following lines
        - map: phpmyadmin.app
          to: /home/vagrant/Code/phpmyadmin

    Reload your homestead
```vagrant reload --provision```

     
goto;

And thatâ€™s it. You have phpmyadmin installed on your Homestead.
